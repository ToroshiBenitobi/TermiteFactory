This project is an intelligent collaborative system for workshop manufacturing in an edge computing environment, aimed at solving the difficulties of collaboration and high costs in workshop manufacturing. It helps businesses to allocate resources reasonably and reduce costs. Using this system, the entire workshop's cloud-edge system can be interconnected. In the cloud, one can view the status of edge computing devices and end devices, as well as information about ongoing tasks, task completion rates, and other data. It also calculates estimated completion times, resource utilization rates, and usage efficiency, displaying these in visual chart formats. Additionally, the system provides two interfaces and user interfaces for both automated and manual resource allocation. It also includes modules for messaging, security control interactions, data exchanges, and logging.
